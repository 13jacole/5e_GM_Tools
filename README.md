# D&D 5th Edition GM Tool Suite

Many of the tools I am making are probably nothing new, but other ones don't do it the way I want.

## Magic Item Selector Tool

A tool that will randomly select X many magic items of Y rarity. Will output/append to specified file.

##### Required packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas


## To Do:

* Brainstorm other tool ideas
	- Random music player tool?
* Increase efficiency in Selector Tool
	- Investigate imports. Can some be removed?
