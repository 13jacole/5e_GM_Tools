# D&D 5th Edition Magic Item Random Selector

It's probably nothing new, but other ones don't do it the way I want.

## TO DO:

 - Determine if initial parameter filters can be handled better
 - Create way to check if restrictions are okay (post-selection check. Loop through each where ...)
 - Add source name/page for easy reference
