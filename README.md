# D&D 5th Edition Magic Item Random Selector

It's probably nothing new, but other ones don't do it the way I want.

## TO DO:

 - Create simple-yet-robust way to query Item type/rarity (Initial paramaters?)
 - Create way to check if restrictions are okay (post-selection check. Loop through each where ...)
 - Create the rest of the basic code
