# D&D 5th Edition GM Tool Suite

Many of the tools I am making are probably nothing new, but other ones don't do it the way I want.

## Magic Item Selector Tool

A tool that will randomly select X many magic items of Y rarity. Will output/append to specified file.

## Music Player

A tool that loops through nested folders of .mp3 and .wav files, playing the contents.

## Character Generator

A tool to generate a level 1 character sheet. Has randomization options.

##### Required packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas


## To Do:

* Tinker with Music Player
	- Maybe a frontend?
* Increase efficiency in Selector Tool
	- Investigate imports. Can some be removed?
* Add Book Selector
	- Character Generator 1.0 assumes all books used
* Levelup?
	- Character Generator 1.0 only creates level 1 characters
